# 📘 Wordly – Single Page Dictionary Application (SPA)

## Project Description
Wordly is a Single Page Application (SPA) that provides an interactive dictionary experience. Users can search for English words and instantly view their definitions, pronunciation, example usage, synonyms, and pronunciation audio without refreshing the page.

This project demonstrates modern front-end web development practices using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, including API integration, event handling, and dynamic DOM manipulation.

## 🚀 Features
- Search for English words using a public dictionary API
- Display word definitions, part of speech, and example usage
- Play pronunciation audio when available
- Display synonyms when provided by the API
- Error handling for invalid or empty searches
- Responsive and user-friendly interface
- Single Page Application behavior (no page reloads)

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Fetch API
- Free Dictionary API

API Endpoint:


---

## 🧠 Task 1: Define the Problem
Users need a fast and interactive way to look up words and understand their meanings without navigating away or refreshing the page. The application must retrieve accurate word data and display it clearly while handling invalid inputs gracefully.

---

## 🎨 Task 2: Determine the Design

### HTML
- A single HTML file
- Search form with input field and submit button
- Section for displaying search results dynamically
- Audio element for pronunciation playback

### CSS
- Styled layout for the search form and results section
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices
- Hover effects and improved readability

### JavaScript
- Functions for fetching word data from the API
- Parsing and displaying API responses
- Event listeners for form submission
- Dynamic DOM updates for seamless interaction

---

## 🛠️ Task 3: Develop the Code

### JavaScript Functionality
- Fetch data from the Free Dictionary API using `fetch()`
- Parse returned JSON data to extract definitions, synonyms, and pronunciation
- Update the DOM dynamically without reloading the page
- Provide fallback messages for missing data
- Play pronunciation audio when available

---

## 🧪 Task 4: Test and Refine

### Testing Performed
- Valid word searches (e.g., "learn", "computer")
- Words without synonyms
- Words without pronunciation audio
- Invalid word searches
- Empty input submission

All errors are handled with clear user-friendly messages.

---

## 📂 Task 5: Document and Maintain

### Version Control
- Git used for tracking project changes
- Regular commits made during development
- Project hosted on GitHub

### Maintainability
- Clean and readable code structure
- Clear comments explaining functionality
- Easily extendable for future features such as saved words or themes
